PyAuto
======

*PyAuto* is a Python interface to *Auto-07p*. It still requires user-supplied Fortran files for parameter continuations,
but allows for a more intuitive usage of *Auto-07p* commands within Python scripts. It provides direct access to 
solutions, branches, and their properties (i.e. special solutions, eigenvalues, etc.) as well as a range of plotting 
functions to visualize bifurcation diagrams and solutions.
